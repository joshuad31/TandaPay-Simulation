<h1 id="background"><span class="header-section-number">1</span> Background</h1>
<p>All modern insurance architectures require that a provider hold funds in reserve for paying future claims. Even models that function outside modern insurance principles such as a takaful (risk sharing groups compliant with Islamic law) are required to use custodians who hold reserves for the purpose of paying future claims. No one has ever seen a working model of insurance that is capable of paying claims that has no custodians and holds no reserves. If it was possible to build a policy using zero-reserve architecture then almost nothing would be known about how these types of architectures would function and what incentive structures would govern the participants.</p>
<p>TandaPay is a zero-reserve architecture that is optimized to produce groups that collapse when invalid claims are submitted for payment. The TandaPay architecture was created to produce incentive structures that maximize for the attribute of intolerance when it comes to dishonest reports by the members. This makes TandaPay an excellent protocol for whistleblowing software because the threat of collapse should theoretically create a willingness for the group to self-censor in order to maintain its existence. Only claims that are viewed by a super majority (above 90% of participants) as valid should ever be approved for payment.</p>
<p>Given the assumption that 40% (or more) of the members are honest, the TandaPay protocol can be proven to have the property of group collapse in response to submission of an invalid claim. What is currently unknown is the minimum threshold of honest participants required to produce this type of collapse. If the threshold required to collapse a group can be proven to be very low, then the degree to which the group self-censors claims should be correspondingly very high.</p>
<p>This dynamic can allow entities outside of the community to have a greater sense of certainty as to a claims validity without knowing the contents of a claim. In this way, the architecture, which would threaten to collapse a group for approving an invalid claim is the same architecture that would bolster credibility of the group for approving a valid claim.</p>
<p>What is needed is a simulation that explores different group attributes to determine which architecture is best optimized to produce groups which collapse with the minimum number of honest participants.</p>
<h1 id="background-as-it-pertains-to-tandapay"><span class="header-section-number">2</span> Background as it pertains to tandaPay</h1>
<p>Zero-reserve escrow technology for setting up insurance mutuals is new. In addition to not holding reserves, the architecture permits members to defect against invalid claims. These defections result in a hefty cost upon members who decide to remain in the community. As members leave, premiums can sharply rise, and it is the rise of premiums that can trigger a chain of events that result in group collapse.</p>
<p>There is a potential novelty associated with determining the honesty of an insurance claim using defections. Insurance mutuals have previously not permitted policyholders to leave the group with a refund of their premium, so little is known about this mechanic. A mechanism that permits defectors within the context of a zero-reserve group has never previously been explored by an academic paper.</p>
<p>Coverage requirements are inflexible demands enforced by smart contracts that claims be paid in full. They mandate that any remaining members make up for the value of premiums that were refunded to defectors. This means that a defectors denial of payment to a claimant requires remaining members to pay an additional cost to make up for this loss.</p>
<p>When coverage requirements are mandated by the system, it causes premiums to increase as members leave the group. Potentially the pairing of these three attributes can produce groups with the property of collapse as a result of a failure to reach consensus on the validity of an insurance claim. It is currently unknown if groups with these attributes can deterministically produce collapse when less than one-third of participants are honest. It is also unknown if there is a threshold of honest participants required to reliably produce collapse.</p>
<p>If it can be shown that the required threshold of a dissenting minority capable of producing group collapse is between 20 to 30% of participants, then the implications related to game theory for determining the honesty of an insurance claim will likely be of profound consequence. The threat of collapse gives the minority an effective means of imposing self-censorship upon the majority. The smaller the minority of honest participants that are required who can effectively prevent a supermajority from colluding to approve an invalid claim, the more an approved claim provides a valuable signal to entities outside of the group. If group collapse (or lack thereof) can become a reliable heuristic (to outsiders) for determining the honesty of an insurance claim then the group has an effective means of generating a historical record that has statistical significance.</p>
<h1 id="goal-of-the-simulation"><span class="header-section-number">3</span> Goal of THE simulation</h1>
<p>It is currently unknown if combining zero-reserve architecture and coverage requirements with a mechanism that permits defections can deterministically produce group collapse when a group's consensus is fractured. If it can be shown that a small dissenting minority can produce sharply rising premiums that effectively result in group collapse, then the implications related to game theory may be of profound consequence. Having an architecture where the threshold of honest participants required to produce collapse is known is likely to be valuable. If TandaPay is one day widely available, models capable of providing the probability that an insurance claim is valid based upon the group's historical record located on the blockchain are therefore also likely to be valuable.</p>
<p>The goal of the simulation is to produce a large and robust data set where multiple variables are evaluated. This data set should correlate architecture with specific starting assumptions to specific group properties. Said another way, the starting assumptions are that smart contracts can enforce inflexible coverage requirements and rising premiums as people defect, skip, or quit (i.e., when a group fractures). Can these starting assumptions be correlated with groups that collapse with a known threshold of honest defectors?</p>
<p>Once correlation is demonstrated, further research may be able to prove a causal relationship between architecture with specific assumptions producing groups with specific properties.</p>
<h1 id="what-is-new-about-tandapay"><span class="header-section-number">4</span> What is new about TandaPay</h1>
<p>TandaPay uses the blockchain to eliminate third party custodians and the ability for smart contracts to enforce inflexible coverage requirements. Previous research into groups such as broodfonds (breadfunds) and ROSCAs did not focus on the attributes of smart contracts being used to strictly enforce that premiums rise as a result of a fracture. Smart contract inflexibility is generally an underappreciated attribute that TandaPay heavily exploits.</p>
<p>In addition, other approaches did not utilize subgroups. Subgroups are important because they provide novel group dynamics that have also been previously underappreciated such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>The decrease in the signal to noise ratio. Subgroups allow defections to be categorized as either honest or selfish.</li>
<li>This feature is not tested by the simulation, but is part of an initial set of assumptions.</li>
<li>Architectures that use subgroups prohibit members from obtaining coverage as individuals; effectively outsourcing the cost of underwriting policies to the group.</li>
<li>This feature is not tested by the simulation, but is part of an initial set of assumptions.</li>
<li>Architectures that use subgroups accelerate group collapse when consensus is fractured because invalid groups impose costs in terms of morale and increased premiums.</li>
<li>The simulation tests this hypothesis.</li>
<li>Architectures that use subgroups inhibit members from acting as individuals by effectively imposing a cost associated with selfish defections and removing that same cost for honest defections.</li>
<li>This feature is not tested by the simulation, but is part of an initial set of assumptions.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="conclusion"><span class="header-section-number">5</span> Conclusion</h1>
<p>The virtue of architecture that can deterministically produce collapse when a group's consensus is fractured is underappreciated. There are thousands of valid configurations for these types of groups. Finding the optimal configuration for collapse will require research, modeling, and the creation of simulations.</p>

<h1 id="relationship-between-ev4-and-pv5"><span class="header-section-number">6</span> Relationship between ev4 and pv5</h1>
<p>The simulation specifies a number of different variables, but the purpose of the simulation is to derive the relationship between the initial number of defectors and the number of members remaining once the group collapses.</p>
<h2 id="definition-of-pv5"><span class="header-section-number">6.1</span> Definition of PV5</h2>
<p>Pricing Variable (PV)5 translates premium prices into group collapse. As members leave, premiums rise for the remaining participants. A group is only allowed to lower the cost of their monthly premiums if no members have left the group in the past 30 days as a result of defections, skipped payments, or a failure to reorg (i.e., quit). PV5 specifies a threshold that the group is unable to stop members from skipping out on paying premiums. Although the variable specifies the degree that premiums are required to rise, this can be directly translated to the number of members remaining once the PV5 threshold is crossed by using the following formula:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[ \frac{Coverage~Requirement}{(PV5 + 1) \times Initial~Premium} = Number~of~Members~Remaining \]</span></p>
<p>The above formula can be derived from:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[ \frac{Coverage~Requirement}{Members} = Premium \]</span></p>
<p>or</p>
<p><span class="math">\[ \frac{Coverage~Requirement}{Members} = Members \]</span></p>
<p>and</p>
<p><span class="math">\[ \Big(\frac{Final~Premium}{Initial~Premium}\Big) - 1 = PV5 \]</span></p>
<h2 id="definition-of-ev4"><span class="header-section-number">6.2</span> Definition of EV4</h2>
<p>Environmental Variable (EV)4 is the number of members who act as honest defectors at the start of the simulation. If enough members defect in the initial wave, their actions result in a chain of events that can push the group over the PV5 threshold. If this happens, the group is effectively unable to continue.</p>
<p>If the number of members specified in PV4 is insufficient, the group will not cross the PV5 threshold and will be capable of changing their coverage requirement thereby enabling members to lower their premiums and avert group collapse.</p>

<h2 id="how-funds-move-through-the-system"><span class="header-section-number">10.5</span> How funds move through the system</h2>
<p>Coverage requirements mandate that the cost of members who defect or skip their premium payments become deficits for any remaining group members. Figure 1 below charts how payments, which were removed by defectors in Function 1, or were never paid by skipped members in Function 2 become accounted for as debt. This debt is then realized as increased premiums calculated in Function 9 and carried forward to the next period by Function 11. If this debt is high enough, it will produce additional members who skip payment of their premiums in Function 2 and the cycle will repeat.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="figure1.png" />
</div>
<p><strong>Figure 1. How Defections Generate Group Debt</strong></p>
<p>If a group has no claims in a given month, the premiums must be returned to members as refunds. The process of returning premiums back to members takes about one month before these refunds become available to lower the cost of future premiums. As show in Figure 2 below, Function 8 determines if the current period has a claim, and Function 11 moves that credit forward into the next period. Finally, the credit reduces the members premiums in Function 2 and thus the likelihood that members will skip payment of their premium.</p>

<h2 id="system-and-user-functions-module"><span class="header-section-number">10.6</span> System and user functions module</h2>
<p>The following sections explain the system and user functions module. The functions and database work together by utilizing the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Most system or user functions evaluate the user record row by row.</li>
<li>The function then modifies the user record if certain conditions are met. This modification may also result in a modification of the system record.</li>
<li>Once all the rows of the user record are completely evaluated, move to the next function.</li>
<li>The functions move from the Pay Stage to the Finalize Stage and then the Reorg Stage.</li>
<li>When all stages are complete, advance to the next period in the system record.</li>
<li>The following includes a step-by-step breakdown of the system and user functions module.</li>

<p>Questions the simulation might be able to answer are as follows:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Chart the cumulative number of defections over the course of the simulation. At termination, did the community collapse?</li>
<li>Iterative runs = the boundary condition for system input variables that produce community collapse.</li>
<li>What percentage of honest participants are required to produce groups which collapse?</li>
<li>How do the different variable inputs contribute to changing the collapse threshold?</li>
<li>Collapse is x% likely to occur with x% of initial defectors = modifying all other variables</li>
</ol>
